A stock represents partial ownership in a company.

When you buy a stock, you own a small piece of that business.
If the company performs well, the stock price may go up.
If the company performs poorly, the stock price may go down.

Stocks are traded on stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq.

Stocks can provide higher returns over time compared to savings accounts,
but they also come with higher risk because prices can fluctuate daily.

Example:
If you buy shares of Apple (AAPL), you become a partial owner of Apple Inc.
