## STOCKS

A stock represents partial ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you own a small piece of that business and become a shareholder. Stocks are also called equities or shares. Each share represents a proportional ownership stake in the company's assets and earnings.

Stocks are traded on stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, and other global exchanges. When you buy a stock, you are purchasing shares from that company or from other investors. The price of a stock reflects what the market is willing to pay for ownership in that company.

Stock prices fluctuate based on the company's performance, market conditions, and investor sentiment. If the company performs well and is profitable, the stock price may increase. If the company performs poorly or faces challenges, the stock price may decrease. Stock prices can change daily or even hourly based on supply and demand.

Stocks can provide higher returns over time compared to savings accounts or bonds, but they also come with higher risk because prices can fluctuate daily and you could lose money. Investors buy stocks hoping the price will increase so they can sell for a profit, or to receive dividends if the company pays them.

Example: If you buy 100 shares of Apple Inc. (ticker symbol AAPL) at $150 per share, you've invested $15,000 and now own a small piece of Apple. If the stock price goes up to $180, your shares are now worth $18,000, gaining $3,000.

## BONDS

A bond is a fixed-income security that represents a loan you make to a company or government. When you buy a bond, you are lending money to the issuer, who promises to pay you back with interest. Bonds are considered safer than stocks because they provide predictable interest payments.

Bond characteristics include: a face value (principal), a coupon rate (interest rate), and a maturity date. When the bond matures, you receive your principal back. Bonds typically offer lower returns than stocks but with lower risk.

## DIVIDENDS

A dividend is a payment made by a company to its shareholders, usually in the form of cash or additional shares. Not all companies pay dividends. Companies that pay dividends typically return a portion of their profits to shareholders as a reward for owning the stock.

Dividend yield is calculated as the annual dividend per share divided by the stock price. A higher yield means better income from dividends. Dividend-paying stocks are popular with income-focused investors who want regular cash payments.

## MUTUAL FUNDS

A mutual fund is a pool of money from many investors used to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. Mutual funds are managed by professional fund managers who make investment decisions on behalf of the fund's investors.

Advantages of mutual funds include instant diversification and professional management. Disadvantages include fees and expenses charged by the fund. Mutual funds are suitable for investors who want diversification without individually selecting securities.

## ETFs (EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS)

An ETF is similar to a mutual fund but trades on stock exchanges like individual stocks. ETFs offer diversification and lower fees than many mutual funds. ETFs can track stock indices like the S&P 500 or focus on specific sectors or themes.

ETFs are more liquid than mutual funds because you can buy and sell them during market hours at market prices. This flexibility makes ETFs attractive to many investors.

## RISK AND DIVERSIFICATION

Risk in investing refers to the possibility of losing money or not achieving expected returns. Different investments carry different levels of risk. Stocks are generally considered riskier than bonds, but offer higher growth potential.

Diversification means spreading your investment across different types of securities, sectors, and asset classes to reduce overall risk. A well-diversified portfolio might include stocks, bonds, real estate, and cash. Diversification cannot eliminate all risk but can help reduce it.

Portfolio volatility measures how much an investment's value fluctuates over time. Higher volatility means larger price swings, indicating higher risk. Lower volatility means more stable prices.

## MARKET INDICES

A stock market index is a statistical measure of the performance of a group of stocks. The S&P 500 tracks 500 large-cap U.S. companies. The Nasdaq focuses on technology and growth stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tracks 30 large-cap U.S. companies.

These indices are used as benchmarks to measure market performance and to gauge the health of the economy. When people say "the market is up," they often refer to these major indices.

## ASSET ALLOCATION

Asset allocation is the process of dividing your investment portfolio among different asset classes like stocks, bonds, real estate, and cash. The right asset allocation depends on your age, risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon.

A younger investor with a longer time horizon might allocate more to stocks for growth. An older investor nearing retirement might allocate more to bonds for stability. Professional advisors help determine appropriate asset allocations.

## DOLLAR-COST AVERAGING

Dollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals regardless of the stock price. This strategy helps reduce the impact of volatility and removes the need to time the market perfectly.

For example, investing $500 per month in a stock fund regardless of market conditions is dollar-cost averaging. Over time, this approach can lead to a lower average cost per share.

## PORTFOLIO REBALANCING

Rebalancing means adjusting your portfolio back to your target asset allocation as market movements change your portfolio's composition. If stocks rise significantly, rebalancing might mean selling some stocks and buying bonds.

Regular rebalancing helps maintain your desired risk level and forces you to buy low and sell high, which is a sound investing principle.
